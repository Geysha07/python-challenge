In this challenge, we wrote scripts for two different data sets, PyBank and PyPoll, in order to analyze the data.

For the PyBank dataset, we wrote a script that would return the total months included in the data set, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes, the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period, and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

For the PyPoll dataset, we wrote a script that would return values for the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
